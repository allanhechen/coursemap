Like I mentioned before, this is my first open source project! I'm still learning how things are
supposed to be done, and I'd love for you to come along with me for the journey.

Our tech stack comes in three layers:

1. The Postgres database
2. Next.js server side rendering for static pages
3. Next.js client side rendering for dynamic pages

The API layer is elminated with Next.js server components, which I believe leads to faster
interaction times and improved SEO (no, I tried finding the project on Google and nothing popped up).

Our frontend is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) along with
[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) React components. Our docs are built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/).

All of our frontend components can be found in the sidebar under `The Components`.
Similarly, the app router can be found in teh sidebar under `App`.

The largest impact you could make is by adding university support described [here](/docs/university-support).
