## Introduction

Coursemap is a web app that aims to guide you through the difficulty of
choosing courses during university.

## Deploying

The app is deployed on [Vercel](https://coursemap-zeta.vercel.app/)
using CI/CD pipelines but can also be run locally from a single
docker-compose file as described in the
[deployment section](/docs/instructions).
