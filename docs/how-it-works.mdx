This is an aside for the `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` environment variable determines how the database
library interacts with Postgres, skip to [Deployment Options](/docs/instructions#delpoyment-options)
for actual instructions.

1. In the `docker` mode, it looks for a local address named `pg_proxy` to send the traffic to.
2. In the `development` mode, it sends the traffic to `localhost:54330`, which is
   the port exposed for `pg_proxy` on your machine.
3. For any other values, default behavior is retained, which means that the database
   library searches for environment variables to Vercel's databases.

In other words, we are hijacking the database library to point towards a local database
somewhat documented [here](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/local-development).
