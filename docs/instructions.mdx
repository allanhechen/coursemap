## Method One: Docker Compose

This method takes in a `docker-compose.yml` file and sets up all of the services required
using the current folder as the base. What's important is that all of your database data
is stored within the pgdata folder, and your application is located at
`http://localhost:3000`.

```yaml
services:
    coursemap:
        build: .
        environment:
            DEPLOYMENT_TYPE: ${DEPLOYMENT_TYPE:-docker}
            POSTGRES_URL: ${POSTGRES_URL:-postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres}
            AUTH_URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth
            AUTH_TRUST_HOST: 1
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
            - pg_proxy
        env_file:
            - .env
    postgres:
        image: postgres:16.4
        environment:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}
        ports:
            - "54320:5432"
        volumes:
            - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        env_file:
            - .env
    pg_proxy:
        image: ghcr.io/neondatabase/wsproxy:latest
        environment:
            ALLOW_ADDR_REGEX: ".*"
            LOG_TRAFFIC: "true"
        ports:
            - "54330:80"
        depends_on:
            - postgres
```

You must configure some additional parameters within a `.env` file for the authentication
providers, along with optionally changing the connection string.

```bash
DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=docker
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres

# generate your own key by running "openssl rand -base64 32"
AUTH_SECRET="your_secret_here"

# add your own app with information from https://github.com/settings/applications/new
# detailed instructions at https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github
AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your_id_here"
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your_secret_here"
```

To deploy, copy the files into the same folder and run the following command in the folder:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Method Two: Development Environment

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

-   We will be using Docker for a local Postgres database, in addition to routing the database traffic through a proxy to emulate Vercel's serverless environment.

2. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/allanhechen/coursemap.git
cd coursemap
```

3.  Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

4. Run the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

5. Head to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000)

## The Plus One: Vercel Deployment

We deploy to Vercel using their CI pipeline. This repository is simply added as a Vercel
project, and Vercel automatically builds and hosts our pull requests. The database is a
Neon database, and everything is hosted on the free tier.
