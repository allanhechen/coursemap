## Method One: Docker Compose

This method takes in a `docker-compose.yml` file and sets up all of the services required
using the current folder as the base. What's important is that all of your database data
is stored within the pgdata folder, and your application is located at
`http://localhost:3000`.

```yaml
services:
    coursemap:
        image: ghcr.io/allanhechen/coursemap:latest
        environment:
            DEPLOYMENT_TYPE: ${DEPLOYMENT_TYPE:-docker}
            POSTGRES_URL: ${POSTGRES_URL:-postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres}
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
            - pg_proxy
    postgres:
        image: postgres:16.4
        environment:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}
        ports:
            - "54320:5432"
        volumes:
            - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    pg_proxy:
        image: ghcr.io/neondatabase/wsproxy:latest
        environment:
            APPEND_PORT: ${APPEND_PORT:-}
            ALLOW_ADDR_REGEX: ".*"
            LOG_TRAFFIC: "true"
        ports:
            - "54330:80"
        depends_on:
            - postgres
```

Optionally, you can configure some additional parameters within a `.env` file for additional
security measures, or to customize the database connection string.

```
DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=docker
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
```

To deploy, copy the files into the same folder and run the following command in the folder:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Method Two: Locally

It is possible to deploy coursemap without a Docker container built around it. There is no
benefit to doing so, especially since you still need to start Postgres and the `pg_proxy`
service.

Regardless, the following steps will get you up and running.

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/allanhechen/coursemap.git
cd coursemap
```

2.  Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

3.  Build the app and copy dependencies

```sh
npm run build
cp -r public .next/standalone/ && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/
cp .env.exmaple .env
```

4. Start the Docker services and the server

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up postgres -d && APPEND_PORT="postgres:5432" docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up pg_proxy -d
DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=local POSTGRES_PASSWORD="password" POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:54320/postgres" node .next/standalone/server.js
```

This method sets the `APPEND_PORT` environment variable to the `pg_proxy` container. It is
not required for deploying within Docker itself, but is for deploying locally. This idea
is reused in the following section with the `.env.development` file.

## Method Three: Development Environment

This section is similar to the one above, but we will not compile Next.js into binaries
and instead run the development script in `package.json`. For completeness, the steps are
listed here below:

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/allanhechen/coursemap.git
cd coursemap
```

2.  Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

3. Run the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

## The Plus One: Vercel Deployment

We deploy to Vercel using their CI pipeline. This repository is simply added as a Vercel
project, and Vercel automatically builds and hosts our pull requests. The database is a
Neon database, and everything is hosted on the free tier.
