import Link from "next/link";

## Usage

```javascript
// See how it is implemented in DashboardComponent for an example
// In short, it needs to be added as a nodeType
// The semesters are retreived and placed automatically
```

## Description

These rest below CourseCards. While there is technically no idea of being "inside" of another node
in ReactFlow, the <Link href="/docs/placement">placement</Link> module allows for cards to be organized
within (on top of) semesters. This means that if a CourseCard is placed on top of a semester, it is
associated with the semester.

Semesters own the space around them, which means that CourseCards do not have to be placed completely within
a semester in order to be associated with it. This is done with semesterPositionContexts, which is further
discussed within the placement module.

Semesters have one visible component, called SemesterData. This component displays the data passed in
the semester, along with an edit button on hover.

Upon interacting with the edit button, a Mantine modal called SemesterForm is presented. This modal will be
pre-filled with the current semester's information. All information is revalidated with the server and re-placed
with the placement module upon submission of a new semester (assuming no errors).

Semesters also implement different scroll handlers for the mouse wheel and touch gestures as follows:

1. onWheel: The wheel action is captured. The larger one (between X and Y) is sent to be handled
2. onTouchMove: Upon the first movement, the position is recorded. The subsequent total movement is captured and sent to be handled

## Props

### Semester

1. `SemesterWrapper`: Semesters are ReactFlow nodes. There is enough information to customize a semester itself, along with some additional ReactFlow options

```javascript
export interface SemesterWrapper {
    data: SemesterInformation;
    isConnectable?: boolean;
    position?: XYPosition;
    id?: string;
    style?: object;
    type?: "semesterNode";
}

export interface SemesterInformation {
    semesterId: number;
    semesterName: string;
    semesterYear: Date;
    semesterTerm: SemesterTerm;
}

export enum SemesterTerm {
    FA = "FA",
    WI = "WI",
    SP = "SP",
    SU = "SU",
}
```

### SemesterData

1. `semesterId`: The semesterId assigned by the server to identify this unique semester

```javascript
// A number
```

2. `semseterName`: The name given to this semester

```javascript
// A string
```

3. `semesterYear`: The year this semester takes place

```javascript
// A date (only the year portion is ever considered)
```

4. `semesterTerm`: The term this semester takes place

```javascript
// One of the following values

export enum SemesterTerm {
    FA = "FA",
    WI = "WI",
    SP = "SP",
    SU = "SU",
}
```

### SemesterForm

Takes in the same props as above, but the blank ones are not pre-filled.
