import { useState } from "react";

import { CourseInformation } from "@/types/courseCard";
import { DnDContext } from "@/app/(main)/dashboard/dndContext";

export default function Demo() {
    const [type, setType] =
        (useState < [string, CourseInformation]) | (null > null);

    return (
        <DnDContext.Provider value={[type, setType]}>

## Description

A component that searches for courses using the <Link href="/docs/course">course</Link> server action.
It takes in the debounced value of the search bar, in addition to the values selected as course chips,
and calls the server action to return a list of courses. These courses are filled within a `SearchResult`
component which renders them out.

Additionally, CourseSearch supports ReactFlow's drag and drop functionality, which is implemented with
the `DnDContext`. As a consequence, it must be wrapped within a `DnDContext.Provider`.

## Props

CourseSearch does not take in any props.
