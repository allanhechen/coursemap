## Description

A component that is used to display courses and their corresponding information. They are a fixed width
and height, and their background color is generated using the <Link href="/docs/color">color</Link> module.

The course code is used to generate one color, the course name is used to generate the other color, and their
concatenation decides the angle of the gradient.

The component is optionally wrapped in the CourseCardWrapper class when passed to ReactFlow, and it uses
the <Link href="/docs/placement">placement</Link> module to handle scrolling.

The CourseCardWrapper class also implements vertical and horizontal scroll handlers which get the distance moved.
The distance is passed to the <Link href="/docs/placement">placement module</Link> where it is dealt with.
It does not deal with touch gestures because they are instead used to drag the cards around.
