import Link from "next/link";

## Usage

```javascript
// See how it is implemented in DashboardComponent for an example
// In short, it needs to be added as a nodeType and then added to the nodes
```

## Description

This component lives solely in ReactFlow as a "deletion area." All CourseCards intersecting with it
upon drop are deleted.

DeleteArea is pushed last within the placement function because it needs to be displayed above
all other nodes (in order to ensure visibility on drag). DeleteArea relies on the onViewportMove handler
defined within the <Link href="/docs/placement">placement library</Link>.

In other words, it is quite simply a rectangle that deletes elements that doesn't do anything by itself.

## Props

DeleteArea does not take in any props.
