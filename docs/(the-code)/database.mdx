-   You have a school
-   You have programs belonging to the school
-   You have courses belonging to a school, that might be required by some programs

-   Users belong to a school and a program
-   Users have their own semesters that they control

-   Semesters have courses within them

-   Courses have pre/post/anti requisites which can be used to construct a tree
-   Courses run during some periods
